ProcIndicator is a small TBC AddOn based on [BacklashIndicator](https://github.com/Oldsalt0/BacklashIndicator) after [Macumba](https://github.com/Macumbafeh)'s request to have it available to all classes/spells and working on any client.   
The addon can only display procs which grant you a buff and it is also working with regular buffs.
   
Available commands are :
* /proc 0-5 - modifies the number of buffs to display (up to 5)
* /proc add - prompts a menu to add/remove buffs
* /proc scale x - adapts addon's scale to x (0.8 - 1.2 recommended)
* /proc lock - locks frame position and hides background
* /proc unlock - unlocks frame position and shows background
* /proc reset - resets frame position and scale

## How to install
- [Download it](https://github.com/Oldsalt0/ProcIndicator/archive/master.zip)
